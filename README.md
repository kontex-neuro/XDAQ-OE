![XDAQ hardware](https://i.shgcdn.com/d17a3299-443e-4441-8bbd-07de7e8fb70f/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/)

Streams data from Kontex XDAQ devices (XDAQ ONE and XDAQ Core).

## Installation

This plugin will soon be available via the Open Ephys GUI's built-in Plugin Installer. Press **ctrl-P** or **⌘P** to open the Plugin Installer, browse to "XDAQ," and click the "Install" button. The XDAQ plugin should now be available to use.

## Usage

Instructions for using the XDAQ Plugin will be available soon.

## Building from source

First, follow the instructions on [this page](https://open-ephys.github.io/gui-docs/Developer-Guide/Compiling-the-GUI.html) to build the Open Ephys GUI.

Then, clone this repository into a directory at the same level as the `plugin-GUI`, and update submodules e.g.:

```
cd OEPlugins
git clone https://github.com/open-ephys-plugins/XDAQ-OE.git
cd XDAQ-OE
git submodule update --init
``` 

```

### Windows

**Requirements:** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/)

From the `Build` directory, enter:

```bash
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 ..
```

Next, launch Visual Studio and open the `OE_PLUGIN_XDAQ-OE.sln` file that was just created. Select the appropriate configuration (Debug/Release) and build the solution.

Selecting the `INSTALL` project and manually building it will copy the `.dll` and any other required files into the GUI's `plugins` directory. The next time you launch the GUI from Visual Studio, the XDAQ plugin should be available.


### Linux

**Requirements:** [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/)

From the `Build` directory, enter:

```bash
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
cd Debug
make -j
make install
```

This will build the plugin and copy the `.so` file into the GUI's `plugins` directory. The next time you launch the compiled version of the GUI, the XDAQ plugin should be available.


### macOS

**Requirements:** [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/)

From the `Build` directory, enter:

```bash
cmake -G "Xcode" ..
```

Next, launch Xcode and open the `XDAQ-OE.xcodeproj` file that now lives in the “Build” directory.

Running the `ALL_BUILD` scheme will compile the plugin; running the `INSTALL` scheme will install the `.bundle` file to `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/open-ephys/plugins-api10`. The XDAQ plugin should be available the next time you launch the GUI from Xcode.
